# VRCWorldsAllusion
A collection of currently around 300 VRChat worlds with tags to properly organize them in Allusion.  
All of these worlds were visited by me and found to be worthy to save. Maybe you like them too.  
Every world/picture has a link to the VRC website of the world in the meta-tag "Creator-URL"  

This is how it looks for me:

## How to use
* Video Guide: https://youtu.be/_j_OKMxluCM
* Download the latest release from here and extract the .zip file: https://github.com/AirpacaSan/VRCWorldsAllusion/releases
* Download and install Allusion from here: https://allusion-app.github.io/

### In Allusion
* Add the folder as a location (top left corner)
* Go to settings (top right corner) > Import/Export > "Import tags from file metadata"

I recommend using the "Vertical Masonry" Grid option.  
The imported tags are not sorted and don't have color.  
Here is how i have them sorted/colored:

This is basically just a folder with a lot of images with meta tags, that Allusion can use.
It is a personal project and will be very subjective, as it represents my personal taste. So for example, there are no horror maps.
I do not intend to make this anything more than a personal project.
